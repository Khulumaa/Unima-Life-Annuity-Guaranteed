Thank you for choosing the Unima Life Annuity Guaranteed Quotation tool!

Before running the application, please follow these steps to ensure smooth operation:

1. Enable Macros:

Macros are powerful tools for automating tasks, but they can also pose security risks if not used properly. By default, Excel disables all macros with notification to protect your data. To enable macros in all Excel workbooks:

- Click on the File tab, then select Options at the bottom of the left bar.
- In the left-side pane, choose Trust Center and click on Trust Center Settings...
- In the Trust Center dialog box, select Macro Settings on the left.
- Choose "Enable all macros" and click OK.

Please note that it's essential to enable only safe macrosâ€”those that you have written, recorded yourself, or obtained from trusted sources. Avoid running macros that you haven't reviewed or don't fully understand.

2. Login Details:

To log in to the application, use the following credentials:

Username: Admin
Password: 12345

3. Import File:

Make sure the import file, titled "Import.xlsx" is within the same folder as the application and the format of the data in the sheet is matained in the same format. 

IMPORTANT: Things You Should Not Do:

- Delete or Edit Sheets:
Please refrain from altering any of the sheets if you are unsure of their purpose. The quotation tool relies on specific named cells and formulas within the sheets to function correctly. Any unauthorized modifications may disrupt the tool's functionality.
- Running the application on a cloud drive
Do not run the application on a cloud drive such as Onedrive or Google Drive for Windows. Excel tends to turn on autosave on such platforms and this does not work well with Macros.
